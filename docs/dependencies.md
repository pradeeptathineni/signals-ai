# Dependency baseline

The public Corpus preview reuses exact-pinned React/Vite, TypeBox's interpreted value checker,
Ajv, Playwright and axe. It adds no search dependency. MiniSearch and Pagefind remain documented
alternatives in ADR-006. GitHub Pages actions are pinned to reviewed upstream commits in
`.github/workflows/pages.yml`; they upload only the validated static public output.

Evidence interchange v1 adds `ajv@8.20.0` and `ajv-formats@3.0.1` (MIT), reviewed
2026-10-05. A separate Ajv draft-2020 instance validates the frozen peer schema without
coercion or default insertion; semantic reference/privacy checks remain in the domain.
The exact schema bytes are excluded from formatting to preserve the interchange digest.

The runtime and verification packages are exact-pinned in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

Development-only Phase 06 tools are exact-pinned: `repomix@1.18.1` (MIT) for bounded repository
maps, `@linger-alpha/cca@0.2.0` (MIT) for a reversible project hook, `knip@6.38.0` (ISC) for unused
code/dependencies, and `jscpd@5.3.3` (MIT) for clone detection. None grants runtime execution
authority or makes a catalog candidate trusted.

On 2026-10-02 GitHub reviewed `GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm`, a high-severity stack-exhaustion advisory
against every published `braces` version through the current `3.0.3`; upstream has no patched
release as of 2026-10-03. Maestro reaches it only through the exact development path
`repomix@1.18.1 -> globby@16.2.4 -> micromatch@4.0.8 -> braces@3.0.3`. The shipped application does
not include Repomix. `context:pack` uses a wrapper that rejects caller arguments, disables Git,
dot-ignore, and package-default pattern sources, refuses implicit `.repomixignore` files, prohibits
brace expansion and oversized patterns (including the output path) in the reviewed repository
configuration, and invokes Repomix with a fixed argument array. `security:audit` therefore requires
that one exact audit payload and
installed path while no fix exists; even an unexpectedly clean report fails while the vulnerable
path remains. It rejects malformed or inconsistent audit metadata, nested high/critical advisories,
any additional high/critical advisory, runtime reachability, version/path change, invocation change,
or changed fix metadata so a patched release must be reviewed and adopted rather than silently
remaining excepted.

The verification gate checks that all direct packages remain at their exact reviewed versions and
use the reviewed MIT, Apache-2.0, ISC, or MPL-2.0 licenses. The 2026-09-29 installed-tree audit
reported zero known vulnerabilities; the later, explicitly bounded no-fix exception is documented
above. These are time-scoped dependency checks, not a claim that the application or dependencies
are universally safe. CI and the local verification gate repeat them.

Npm's local build-script policy may block optional `esbuild`/`fsevents` lifecycle scripts. Maestro
does not require a global policy change: the pinned Vite build and browser gate are used to verify
the effective installation.

G6 is lazy-loaded and owns drawing/layout only. Readability runs only on already bounded,
allowlisted HTML; jsdom scripts and resource loading remain disabled and only plain extracted text
is persisted. AI SDK has no default model route in Maestro: only an explicit loopback-compatible
endpoint can enable the optional adapter, SDK retries are disabled/accounted by the application,
and no model or embedding artifact is downloaded automatically. The declared input-token limit is
checked against endpoint-reported usage when present; absent usage is recorded as unmeasured. See the
[Phase 06 reference](architecture/phase-06-reference.md) for local integration contracts.
