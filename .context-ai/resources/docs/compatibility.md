# v1 compatibility and migration

Library version 1.0.0 and integer schema versions have separate meanings. Loadout, resolution/installation, evidence and existing model routing use schema 1. Changes to their documented fields or semantics require compatibility review; published tags are immutable.

Core modules and existing concept/profile/route IDs remain stable. The concept index retains string definitions for existing lookup consumers and adds a details map with aliases, scope, module, decision and evidence links. Kit seed concept names remain in immutable bootstrap decisions and are resolved by the explicit alias map in the contract validator; they are not new mandatory Signals vocabulary.

House policies moved from custom/ to overlays/. Every old custom Markdown path remains a short routing document; a linked overlay is loaded only after an actual read. Existing standard skill and lookup entrypoints keep working. New consumers should select overlays through loadouts. No private neon1 information belongs in this public library.

Codex is the only supported materialization adapter in v1. Its project-local skill routers use unique context-prefixed names; the existing standard discovery name is untouched. Instruction-only upstream adaptations declare omitted binaries/hooks and preserve pinned documentation/notice files. A project can continue a stage on its earlier lock while the library advances; review a refresh at a checkpoint before changing the active pin.

Exact snapshots remain available in Git commits and exported release/checkpoint archives. Materialization does not retrieve an old revision automatically: use the exact checkout/archive to reproduce that pin. The bootstrap checkpoint is 0.3.0-bootstrap.1, not an earlier claim to stable v1.
